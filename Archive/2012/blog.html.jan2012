<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>1 Aug 2011:<br />We
had a great turnout downstairs at the Rockit last Friday. Even better,
our draw was bigger than the _upstairs_ band that night (!) so we hope
to return there soon. The other two bands on the bill really brung it
and we'll be seeing more of those guys too. This week I'll be at Grant
&amp; Green SF with Redwood Wires again, and later in the week&nbsp;in
the pit for a short run of Sweeney Todd in Berkeley (flute, clarinet). </small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>16 Jun 2011:<br />Chick Jagger &amp; Sticky Fingers have just announced a mega-tribute show at <a href="http://www.rock-it-room.com/">Rockit Room</a>
in SF scheduled for Fri Jul 29.&nbsp; Sharing the bill are Gene Genie
(Bowie tribute) and Liquid Sky (Jimi Hendrix tribute). &nbsp;</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>9 Jun 2011:<br />Special guest appearance tonight on sax/flute with indie rock <a href="http://reverbnation.com/redwoodwires">Redwood Wires</a>.

&nbsp;You can hear my clarinet on the new release from SF pop/rock
artist <a href="http://fireheadjerry.com/">Firehead Jerry</a>
release titled "Sidewalks", on track "Get It Done". Wide release
available on iTunes and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028MVKSE/ref=dm_dp_adp">Amazon.</a>
I recorded a bunch of other stuff&nbsp;for them too, some of which
might have ended up on other tracks, and it's all great stuff anyhow,
so you might as well download the whole thing ;-P</small></p>
