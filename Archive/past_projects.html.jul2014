Until then, a never-complete list of past projects.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chick Jagger</span> - Rolling Stones Tribute in SF</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Millville Plains </span>-
&nbsp;Edgy Alt-Rock Americana original band from SF, with select covers
(Neil Young, The Band, Sublime) founded by a couple guys from Lake Co.
We recorded a bunch of live tracks at Cheers Pacifica which came out so
good they were released on a record "Live with the MVPs." This same
record also has a couple of tracks with sax player and blues sideman
Jimmie Sancious on it.&nbsp; Fans of early Springsteen may recognize
Jimmie as the brother of Dave Sancious, original keys player for the E
Street Band.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yung Mars &amp; The BaySix </span>-
I was looking to get out of rock for a while and play "other stuff"
that was original music. One day I came across a CL ad for hip-hop
horns. That sounded just fine. I was kinda terrifed though. I almost
didn't go to the first meeting. I actually drove all the way there, got
to the front door, chickened out, drove all the way home. Sitting in my
driveway i came to an epiphany: Who The Hell Am I if I am not goin to
Try New Things ?? Drove all the way back, and finally went into the
meeting (an hour late, but in hip-hop turns out this is not even
noticed). This was a really cool project that pushed the boundaries of
original soul-hip-hop. I wrote many of the horn lines and tried to
recruit/retain a horn section. We did light touring to L.A. and played
several cool shows at Poleng Lounge (now closed) and other
places.&nbsp; At the 2-yr mark, as often happens, things fell
apart;&nbsp; MC Yung Mars went on to form another group
with&nbsp;different
players, Billy the bassist went on to form the Mug Push collective
with&nbsp;different players. They're both active in SF (2011) Before it
ended, Billy&nbsp;had given me listening
CDs with a view to the horn section sound they were shooting for; one
of these was a Fania All-Stars compilation that I played endlessly, and
this inspired me to get into salsa and latin jazz, which I happily play
today.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lick</span> -&nbsp; the early incarnation of Sticky Fingers, an attempt at
an all-female Stones Tribute. Things didn't work out, but the remnants
of that group went on to form the wildly-successful CoverGrrrlz classic
rock cover band, a multi-107.7-Bone-award winner and local festival
band.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Groovy Judy</span>
- When I met Judy, I had just become a sax player. I was not a good sax
player, at all. Pretty much sucked. Still, trial by fire is the best
teacher. I am grateful to Judy for basically allowing me to pay my dues
in her band, and allowing me to become a better sax player through it.
I also enjoyed being able to sing and occasionally play keyboard,
although i was a much better keyboard player at the time. There is a
keyboard "mission creep" that affects sax players that double on keys,
but i had a blast anyhow. Judy is a great booker; we did tons and tons
and tons of bars, festivals, marathons, corporate events, TV shows,
you-name-it. I was pregnant when I started with her band, and again a
year later; I can safely say I spent as much time playing pregnant for
Judy as in the non-pregnant state. When I wasn't playing pregnant, I
was in the bathroom during band breaks pumpin' dat breastmilk :-|
&nbsp;Their schedule caught up with me after&nbsp;#2 came along and I
went on hiatus from Judy after.&nbsp; Judy's still around doin' her
thing, especially in peninsula woods and the east bay festival circuit.</small></p>

Kaif</span>
-&nbsp;In 2000 a bunch of Indian and Pakistani guys at
Stanford were looking for guest players for their indo-rock/folk
project. They played a mix of Junoon, Vital Signs etc. plus a few
originals. I got involved because I love Paki rock, and
owned a sitar that I didn't play very well and needed a tolerant
audience for&nbsp;;-) I did a single show at Stanford with them and
also
played clarinet on a couple of songs. This was a really fun
project, but&nbsp;made me realize i needed serious P.A.
for the sitar to make it work in a rock setting, and regardless i
really
sucked
at it.&nbsp;All of those guys have
graduated and moved on, some are working in high-tech in the valley and
for very well-known companies, if you know what I mean... in the
valley, i guess the lure of music can never beat the cache of a
standfordalumni.org email address.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Squeegees with Tom Torriglia </span>-
Now, this is my cautionary tale. The one where you miss your gig and
get fired :-(
&nbsp;I was on a mission to be a rock-star polka clarinet player. This
was the perfect band for it. And it was also the most $$ I ever made
playing
clarinet, to this day. There's only one thing wrong with it: you are
not supposed to book a gig on your own wedding anniversary. (Why didn't
someone tell me that there is no such thing as an "excused absence" in
this world??)&nbsp;I'm anyhow grateful to Tom for giving me the
chance to play Clarinet Polka in front of appreciative audiences. Tom,
just so you know, I have not missed another gig. Not in 10 years. Not
ever.</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small></small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Super Sunday Bunch</span>
- impromptu name for a one-off blues recording project, named only for
the happy coincidence the session took place on super bowl sunday. I sing and play
clarinet throughout the 4-song EP, to Robert Johnson and other
blues classicss. The CD was panned by Blues Revue (now defunct), who
also got the name of my "band" wrong, but
hey, it was not bad for my first try at a studio recording with a
buncha hired guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spike Connor (Simply Jazz, Swingin'
Havoc, Overcurve, Blues Wizards) co-produced
the CD and helped me find the right players, including the guitarist
for this session - Futoshi Morioka (Greggs Eggs, Second Hand Smoke,
Cast of Clowns) who proved to be a formidable
guitar-slinger, and he only cost me a hundered bucks for the day. Bet
he costs a lot more than that now !! <br />
