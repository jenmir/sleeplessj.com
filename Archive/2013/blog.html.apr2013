<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>17 Dec 2012<br />Now
that most of the holiday craziness has died down, time for an update
:-) Last year I came to know of a new chamber orchestra that was
forming in my area. This new group calls themselves the <a href="http://nmchamberorchestra.org">New Millenium Chamber Orchestra</a>
(not to be confused with New Century - that name was already taken,
obviously) and is headed by Richard Frieman (D.M.A., Stanford). I had
the opportunity to sub on clarinet with them a few months back and was
extremely impressed by their high level of musicianship. The players
tend to hail from upper peninsula between San Carlos and Daly City;
many&nbsp;are nationally recognized in their instruments; their players
include former members of&nbsp;Houston Symphony, Houston Ballet
Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Air Force Band, &nbsp;SF Opera
Orchestra, and a 2-time National Fiddle Champion. The group is just
getting off the ground and tends toward public-domain repertory
(probably to save $), but also plays commissions and new original works
- their last concert closed with a "world premier" of a new film score
piece by noted composer <a href="http://littlehorsemusic.com">Joachim Horsley</a>,
who was in attendance&nbsp;that night. It is always a great honor for
an orchestra to be chosen to premier a piece, meaning this new group is
off to a fantastic start - and kudos to them for finding an untapped
niche for classical talent in this part of the Bay Area. On the night I
was subbing they just happened to be taking pubilicity photos, and I
was caught in one of them which appeared on the front page of the local
San Mateo paper. That same week the Slippery Slope was performing at
Bottom of the Hill and received coverage in the Bay Guardian for that
show, which included a picture also. Quite surprised to see my picture
in two different papers on one week, for two different groups :-P&nbsp;
The Slippery Slope also headlined a show at Yoshi's SF this fall, on
the big stage. This was somewhat nerve-wracking due to being summoned
to sound check at 4pm (for a 9pm show), and the check ran two hours...
but the sound and layout was terrific and we had a great turnout for an
intimate Sunday night show. I took pics of the "green room" as well as
the "orange room", both well-appointed and probably as nice&nbsp;a
backstage area I have yet seen. Someday i'll get around to posting
those pics LOL .</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small></small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>6&nbsp;Jun 2012<br />I'm still recovering from May 5, with a whopping
three shows on that day starting with cinco de mayo festival in Dolores
with Picante - thank you thousands of people, wherever you are -
followed by Redwood Wires show at Parkside for an afternoon happy hour,
followed by a private event with Picante. Picante is sad to be losing
our pianist and founding member Sanjay "Sanjito" - we wish him well and
will see him off to Europe this month. Tough job finding a montuno
pianist to replace him (!!) Chick Jagger &amp; the Fingers will rock at
the very nicely appointed Club Fox (formerly Little Fox) in Redwood
city, opening for Led Zepagain. Those of you who are attending the Air
Supply show at Fox Theater next door that night may feel free to send
your date over to check us out if Air Supply isn't to their liking
(hahaha) &nbsp;The Slippery Slope lounge revival played the Sacramento
French Film Festival this spring, entertaining filmgoers in an
abandoned car dealership in downtown Sac&nbsp;set up as a temporary
shrine to the late Serge Gainesborg. Slippery Slopers will also be
headlining Bottom of the Hill this month plus&nbsp;getting a nice
write-up in the Bay Guardian to promote the show (woo hoo! how the heck
do you get those things anyway?)&nbsp;RW is in the studio wriiting a
bunch of new songs and we'll be debuting those soon and hopefully
working on CD #2 by this year's end. No time to vacation and relax this
summer!</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>&nbsp;</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>2 Jan 2012<br />Been
too long since the last update here, but things have been busy at the
end of the year. First off, Chick Jagger &amp; Sticky Fingers returned
to the Rockit Room again - apparently, they love us - and played
downstairs (again) to an extremely enthusiastic crowd. Our
openers/co-bill this time were a special Doors tribute visiting from
L.A. and locals Just Cream. The Slippery Slope lounge/torch ensemble
had successful outings at Van Kleef , Yoshis, Knockout and 50 Mason;
they will return to 50 Mason twice next spring as well. This is a
really neat act for those who don't like "loud" bands but want to visit
something closer to Henry Mancini &amp; Burt Bacharach type
orchestrations. Redwood Wires played a private event opening for
Switchblade Nixon, a really awesome classic rock cover-party band that
gigs infrequently but has an appreciative following. Finally, Conjunto
Picante returned to the newly-remodeled Cigar Bar in December; doubled
the venue's performance space and believe it or not they _still_ pack
the dance floor even thus! </small><small>I am glad that we put ourselves out as a Puerto Rican band, and
we should continue that tradition. We should also continue having
famous Puerto Ricans dropping by on our gigs too... Band members</small><small>
were stunned by the mystery man strolling into the venue at 12am with a
trombone case - it turned out to be none other than&nbsp;Jimmy Bosch
(!!) fresh from Eddie Palmieri's gig, and he sat in for a couple of
songs and even sang out the coro to Elena, Elena. What a treat, and an
honor to know that a player of Jimmy's caliber heard what we were doin'
and wanted to be a part of it!</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>1 Aug 2011:<br />We
had a great turnout downstairs at the Rockit last Friday. Even better,
our draw was bigger than the _upstairs_ band that night (!) so we hope
to return there soon. The other two bands on the bill really brung it
and we'll be seeing more of those guys too. This week I'll be at Grant
&amp; Green SF with Redwood Wires again, and later in the week&nbsp;in
the pit for a short run of Sweeney Todd in Berkeley (flute, clarinet). </small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>16 Jun 2011:<br />Chick Jagger &amp; Sticky Fingers have just announced a mega-tribute show at <a href="http://www.rock-it-room.com/">Rockit Room</a>
in SF scheduled for Fri Jul 29.&nbsp; Sharing the bill are Gene Genie
(Bowie tribute) and Liquid Sky (Jimi Hendrix tribute). &nbsp;</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>9 Jun 2011:<br />Special guest appearance tonight on sax/flute with indie rock <a href="http://reverbnation.com/redwoodwires">Redwood Wires</a>. Many thanks also to those who showed up at <a href="http://conjuntopicante.com">Conjunto Picante's</a>
CD release event on June 4 - the turnout was fantastic and we got to
see and hear old friends and band alumni ! &nbsp;Thank you also to the kind sponsor of <a href="http://myspace.com/millvilleplains">Millville Plains</a> second set at Cheers last week - MVP and our good friends <a href="http://allofasudden.com">All Of A Sudden</a>
thank you for the free round :-) we're&nbsp; holding down first
wednesdays at Cheers and building an awesome music scene in Pacifica
(of all places).&nbsp;</small></p><p style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);"><small>20 Apr
2011:<br />
Two shows&nbsp; - first with <a href="http://chickjagger.com">Chick

at the new Showroom in SF this Sat&nbsp;7pm. Then Easter Sunday

at Kimo's SF. The <a href="http://reverbnation.com/redwoodwires">Redwood
Wires</a> sound a bit like Smiths/Morphine/Sabbath all mixed
together. </small></p>
